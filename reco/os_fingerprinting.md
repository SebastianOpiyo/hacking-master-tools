# What is OS Fingerprinting

TCP/IP stack fingerprinting is the remote detection of the characteristics of a TCP/IP stack implementation.

Some of the stack implemetation used to detect the characteristics include:
   - Initial packet size (16 bits)
   - Initial TTL (8 bits)
   - Window size (16 bits)
   - Max segment size (16 bits)
   - Window scaling value (8 bits)
   - "don't fragment" flag (1 bit)
   - "sackOK" flag (1 bit)
   - "nop" flag (1 bit)
